# Alloy

Alloy is the middleware/interface to the BareMetal kernel.

### Building

Currently, Alloy can only be built by the build scripts of the BareMetal operating system.

While this may change in the future, right now it is not supported.

### Dependencies

To build it, you'll need FreeType installed.

On Ubuntu, you'd install it like this:

```
sudo apt install libfreetype6-dev
```
